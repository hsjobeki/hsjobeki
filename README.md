# Greetings, Earthlings!

## ðŸš€ Quick Facts

- **Nix Wizard**: I speak Nix fluently, and no, it's not a magic spell. Or is it?
- **Coffee nerd**: I turn coffee into code. That's it.
- **Frontend Charmer & System Tamer**: Making UIs and systems bend to my will, usually with a smile.
- **Open Source Rebel**: Fighting for the open-source galaxy, one commit at a time in the Nix/NixOS universe.

## ðŸŽ¯ On My Radar

Crafting more spells in Nix, taming the wild beasts of Rust and TypeScript, and sometimes accidentally breaking (and fixing) the internet.

## ðŸ“¡ Signal Me!

- **Matrix**: Find me in the matrix (not the movie) at [#johannes.kirschbauer:scs.ems.host](https://matrix.to/#/#johannes.kirschbauer:scs.ems.host).
- **Blog**: For laughs, gaffes, and a little bit of wisdom, check [my blog](https://hsjobeki.dev/blog).

Let's code, laugh, and maybe cause a minor digital apocalypse together! ðŸ¤–
